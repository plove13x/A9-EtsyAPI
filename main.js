All bracelets will be made to coordinate the team colors with an OFFICIALLY LICENSED NBA CHARM. If you would like a different color combination, please leave a message in the note section/box at checkout with your color choices from the above color chart.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE:\r\ncolor edge- Midnight Blue\r\ncolor inside- Colonial Blue\r\ncolor center line- Silver Gray\r\n\r\n*****MORE NBA TEAMS AVAILABLE*****\r\n\r\nIf you would like to add a metal 3/8&quot; side release buckle to your bracelet instead of the standard plastic buckle, follow the link below:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/167926294/metal-buckle-upgrade-with-any-paracord?ref=shop_home_active\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT ****MEASUREMENT NOTE*****\r\nAll of our paracord bracelets are made to order according to the measurement you select from the above drop down menu. It is very important that you follow the directions provided in the listing details on how to measure your wrist . We are not responsible if you select the wrong measurement. Please double check your order to make sure everything is correct. \r\n\r\nHOW TO MEASURE YOUR WRIST\r\nWrap a sewing tape measure, string or a piece of paper around your wrist and mark where they meet with no slack in it. Measure the string or paper to find your size in inches with a ruler or tape measure. (You can see the photos above which will show you how to get a correct wrist measurement.) DO NOT measure another bracelet or watch including another paracord bracelet that you may have. We will add a little extra paracord to the measurement you select to allow for comfort. If you do not select the correct measurement the bracelet will not fit. All bracelets are made to the measurement you select. The bracelet will fit comfortable as long as you follow these instructions. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. We are happy to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE WRIST MEASUREMENT: \r\nIF YOUR EXACT WRIST MEASUREMENT IS LISTED IN THE ABOVE &quot;WRIST MEASUREMENT&quot; DROP DOWN MENU, THEN YOU WILL SELECT THAT EXACT MEASUREMENT. IF YOUR EXACT WRIST MEASUREMENT IS NOT LISTED, THEN YOU NEED TO SELECT THE WRIST MEASUREMENT CLOSEST TO YOUR EXACT WRIST MEASUREMENT. EXAMPLE: EXACT WRIST MEASUREMENT IS 6 3/8 INCHES, YOU NEED TO SELECT 6 1/2 INCHES (ROUND UP), WE WILL ADD A LITTLE EXTRA CORD TO THE MEASUREMENT YOU SELECT SO YOU WILL HAVE A COMFORTABLE FITTING BRACELET. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING HOW TO MEASURE, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT US!\r\n\r\nPLEASE BE SURE TO SELECT THE CORRECT WRIST MEASUREMENT WITH YOUR ORDER. YOU ARE SELECTING A WRIST MEASUREMENT NOT A BRACELET MEASUREMENT, BIG DIFFERENCE!\r\n\r\n****Unauthorized use of these photos is strictly prohibited without written consent of Ford&#39;s Cord & Supplies****\r\n\r\nWe invite you to visit our entire store.\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/FordsCordandSupplies\r\n\r\nNo emergency kit is complete without 550 Paracord (Parachute Cord).

If you have any questions regarding the shipping time frame of your order, please contact us.\r\n\r\nWe do offer a Priority Shipping upgrade. This upgrade is added to the already listed shipping fee. Priority Shipping has an estimated delivery time of 1-3 days instead of the standard 3-5 days. Priority Shipping also has insurance included for up to $50. Express Priority Shipping has insurance for up to $100. Ordering Priority Shipping only gets your order delivered to you quicker through the USPS. I do not put orders in front of others just because you order the shipping upgrade. If you need your order made and shipped the same day, you will need to contact me to order the &quot;RUSH MY ORDER&quot; listing for an additional $10.\r\n\r\n**ATTENTION** If you are paying with PayPal, we will only ship to the address provided on your PayPal account.  If you are shipping to someone else, please make sure all information is correct. You will need to change the shipping address with PayPal when shipping to a different address.  We will NOT change any shipping information once payment through PayPal is made.  This is for security reasons! \r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS:\r\nWe cannot be responsible for any customs fees that may apply and/or any delays of your package.\r\n\r\n*** We are not responsible for lost, stolen or damaged packages. You must contact USPS concerning this. We are not responsible for your package once it is in the hands of the Postal Service. If you prefer to have insurance on your package, simply select USPS Priority Shipping with your order. Having insurance on your package is the only way to protect from damages, stolen, or lost packages. All Priority Shipping includes insurance, up to $50, through USPS.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about our shipping policies, please do not hesitate to contact us.\r\n\r\nCustom made charms will take 5-7 days to complete even if you select Priority Mail or Priority Mail Express.  Due to the processing time needed for the resin that is used on most of our custom charms, it will take longer to complete your order.  If the regular time frame for completing an order is 3-5 business days, any order with custom charms will take a couple of extra days.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.",

            "description": "Sports Fan Infinity Scarf/ Chunky Scarf Royal Blue and Yellow\r\n\r\nThis Infinity Scarf was inspired by my love of sports and joy that crocheting gives me.  I have spent many hours at my daughter’s games, either volleyball or softball.  I so enjoy those moments. As I watched, I would work on a scarf or other items and I would get a lot of complements and many requests to make a scarf in their chosen colors. Which lead me to offering them to you. They are all hand made with sports colors in mind. Whether it is a Pro Team, College Team, Club Team, or School, this scarf can be worn as a long loop, warped around to create a cowl look, or folded and tucked for the flat look.  These scarves are great additions to your wardrobe, even on the non-game days, but perfect for those Go-Team-Win days. Support you team, be that Great Fan and wear a Sports Fan Infinity Scarf.\r\n\r\nColor used on this item:\r\nBlue and Yellow/Chunky Yarn\r\n\r\nMeasurements\r\n(approximate) \r\nLength : 58 inches\r\nWidth : 8 inches\r\n\r\nMATERIAL Used in this item\r\nAcrylic, Polyester blend\r\n\r\nMaterial Care of this item:\r\nMachine wash warm in cold water; Lay flat to dry.
